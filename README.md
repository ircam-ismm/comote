# CoMote

## Development

### Installation
Install `Node.js`. Prefer the long-term support (LTS) version, at least v16.

Install (or update) `npm`, `yarn` and `eas-cli` globally.

```sh
npm -g install npm yarn eas-cli
```markdown

Install project dependencies with `yarn`.

```sh
yarn install
```

Tested with:
- node 22
- java 17
- npx expo (locally installed in project, not global, also called "versioned expo")

### Android and iOS Build tools

As we are using `react-native-udp` which is not included in expo-go, we must create
a custom development build that include the binaries from `react-native-udp`.

cf. https://docs.expo.dev/development/introduction/

Therefore we need the build tools for android (Android Studio) and iOS (XCode)

#### Android notes

##### Android SDK

Install Android studio. After installation, you can choose `More Actions` then `SDK Manager` to configure SDK tools and emulators.

- In `SDK Platforms`tab, you may need to install extensions `*-ext` for you current platform.

- In `SDK Tools`, install:
  - Command-line tools
  - You may need to install `NDK`, `CMake`



For local builds, The paths to the Android SDK must be registered in `eas.json` for each build channel, i.e.:

```json
"build": {
  "development": {
    "developmentClient": true,
    "distribution": "internal",
    "android": {
      "buildType": "apk"
    },
    "env": {
      "ANDROID_SDK_ROOT": "~/Library/Android/sdk"
    }
  },
},
```

In your profile we should also something like to access `adb` (and probably other things):

```bash
# android
export ANDROID_HOME="${HOME}/Library/Android/sdk"
if [ -d "$ANDROID_HOME" ] ; then
    export PATH="${PATH}:${ANDROID_HOME}/tools:${ANDROID_HOME}/platform-tools"

    if [ -d "${ANDROID_HOME}/ndk" ] ; then
        android_ndk_version="$( basename "$(ls -d "${ANDROID_HOME}/ndk"/* | tail -1 )" )"
        export ANDROID_NDK_HOME="${ANDROID_HOME}/ndk/${android_ndk_version}"
    fi
fi
```

##### Java

The build tools require the Java JDK 17, cf. :
- <https://adoptium.net/fr/temurin/releases/>


Then select a version in you shell profile.
```bash
# android studio tools
export JAVA_HOME="$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 17)"
```

#### Apple Notes

##### Xcode

Install Xcode, and open it. Install iOS platform.

##### Dependencies

```sh
brew install fastlane
brew install cocoapods
```

Note: if you install native modules, you must install cocoapods again. One way is to run again `npx expo prebuild`.

##### Certificates

Notes:

- it might be easier to do deal with certificates with Xcode, and eas.
- you might need to be admin at <developer.apple.com>

Create a certificate signing request using Keychain.app <https://developer.apple.com/help/account/create-certificates/create-a-certificate-signing-request>

Use it to create a new certificate from you Apple developer account. <https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list>

You may also need to import distribution certificates from expo.dev
<https://expo.dev/accounts/ircam-ismm/settings/credentials>

### Local development and pre-build

Generate prebuild folders, named `ios` and `android`.

```sh
npx expo prebuild
```

(The previous command may fail due to the debugger of Visual Studio Code. In that case, try to run in in a standard terminal.)

If it does not build, you will need to remove the created folders.

```sh
rm -rf ios android
```

### Android

Generate development build.
```sh
eas build --local --profile development --platform android
```

Install on device.

You can use an http-server:
```sh
npm -g install http-server
http-server .
```
On device, open Google Chrome and type the URL given by the server. Download and install the apk.

You can also install via `adb`.
- plug the device
- trust the computer
- allow for file transfer from USB
- allow developer mode on device
- type `adb install build-latest.apk`

You can also install and run a build on a device with the following command:

```sh
npx expo run:android --device
```

### iOS

You can install and run a build on a device with the following command:

```sh
npx expo run:ios --device
```

Alternatively, you can generate development build.

```sh
eas build --local --profile development --platform ios
```

Be sure to select the local devices allowed to install the app.

If it does not build, use xCode. In particular, check the signing capabilities.

```sh
xed ios
```

- plug your device
- trust the computer
- in xCode, select the device, then click `Run` to build, install, and run the application on the device
- click `Stop` to stop the application on the device

To install and run on an iOs simulator, repeat the xCode procedure (select a simulated device, then run and stop).


### Expo

Start expo. (The `--dev-client` is unnecessary since expo 49.)

```sh
npx expo start
```

Expo-go must be installed on the device, but you should use the installed pre-built application.

Flash the QR-code to start the application:
- iOS: use the `Camera` app
- Android: use the `Expo-Go` app

Warning, if you use a local IP, you should generate an ad-hoc QR-code. Here is an exemple for `10.10.0.1`

```sh
npm -g install qrcode
qrcode 'exp+comote://expo-development-client/?url=http%3A%2F%2F10.10.0.1%3A8081'
```

You can enter URL manually in your development built app  `http://10.10.0.1:8081`


While running app, shake the device on the left or on the right to access the debugger. You can deactivate that in the menu, as you might want to shake the device. Then, type `m` in the console where you started expo to toggle the menu.

You can press `j` in the console to start a debugger.


### Pre-production test

The easiest way to simulate how your project will run on end users' devices is with the command:

```sh
npx expo start --no-dev --minify
```

However, this might no be enough, as the build is different. It notably differs when the app is suspended (move to background, device lock). Note the usage of the `--device` flag to be able to select a real device.

```sh
npx expo run:ios --configuration Release --device
```



### Build and deploy


```sh
yarn install
```


#### iOS

Build (online) and submit.
```sh
eas build --profile production --platform ios
eas submit --platform ios
```

If the submission fails, use the expo.dev website:
<https://expo.dev/accounts/ircam-ismm/projects/comote>

Sometimes it is not possible to log to the Apple developer account. It is possible to build without connecting, using old credentials.


#### Android

Build (online) and submit.
```sh
eas build --profile production --platform android
eas submit --platform android
```

If there is a problem during submission, it might be necessary to to a manual submission. This can happen if there is a new permission for the application or when Google changed its policy.

Download the build artifact and submit via the Google Play Console. It might trigger a new permission setting, that was not displayed until a version uses a build that uses this permission.

## Update

```sh
rm -rf yarn.lock node_modules
yarn install
yarn upgrade --latest
npx expo-doctor
npx expo install --fix
npx expo-doctor
rm -rf android ios
```

Prebuild and build again the development versions, to use with expo.

## Message format

### WebSocket

```javascript

  }
}

```

### OSC format

Notes:

- All values are float32 `f`, int32 `i` or string `s`. Complex values must be serialised to a string.
- `timestamp` is a monotonic time in milliseconds that should start at 0 with the application to fit in float32, or it should be a float64.
- Undefined values are set to -1.
- Any boolean value is converted to an integer: 1 for true and 0 for false

```text

## TODO

### BUGS

- [ ] fix full-screen glitches
  - [ ] do not reload page
    - in React (CoMote), re-use WebView (cf. `createPortal`, `forwardRef`, etc.)
    - in Soundworks (user WebView), use createHook on the server side

- [ ] bad sample rate on first run of application (100 ms instead of 10 ms as displayed)
- [ ] wake-up lock does not work with iPhone XR and iOS 17.12

- [x] Any platform: check connection status
- [x] Any platform : change OSC port while connected: should reconnect
- [ ] Any platform: missing or late samples on touch screen events
  Wait for engine to run in background
- [x] iOS: after device sleep: sample period is 100ms
- [ ] iOS: not all sample period values allowed:
  - [ ] 5 ms is not possible, gives 10
  - [ ] 10 ms seems fine
  - [ ] 15 ms oscillates between 10 and 20
  - [ ] 20 ms seems fine
  - [ ] 30 ms oscillates between 20 and 40
  - [ ] 40 ms seems fine
  - [ ] keep:
     - 0 for auto
     - 10
     - 20
     - 40

- [ ] Android: sample period is a little more than specified
- [ ] every 5ms?
     - 0 for auto
     - 10 (request 9)
     - 20 (request 18)
     - 40 (request 38)
